# The webhint extension for Visual Studio Code

Use webhint, a customizable linting tool, to improve the functionality of your site, including:

*   Accessibility.
*   Performance.
*   Cross-browser compatibility.
*   PWA compatibility.
*   Security.

webhint checks your code for best practices and common errors.  Identify and fix problems in your files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.  Hints appear as wavy underlines in the text editor, and are summarized in the **Problems** pane:

webhint is an open-source project.  It was initially developed by the Microsoft Edge team, and is now part of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org).  The Microsoft Edge team continues to contribute to webhint alongside web developers in the community.

For more information, see the [webhint](https://webhint.io) site.

## Configuring webhint in Visual Studio Code

This extension uses a [default configuration](https://github.com/webhintio/hint/blob/master/packages/configuration-development/index.json) json file that activates hints and parsers for HTML, CSS, templating systems (JSX/TSX, Angular, and so on), JavaScript/TypeScript, and more.

```json
{
    "connector": "local",
    "extends": [
        "accessibility",
        "progressive-web-apps"
    ],
    "formatters": [
        "html",
        "summary"
    ],
    "hints": [
        "apple-touch-icons",
        "button-type",
        "compat-api/css",
        "compat-api/html",
        "create-element-svg",
        "css-prefix-order",
        "disown-opener",
        "highest-available-document-mode",
        "manifest-exists",
        "meta-charset-utf-8",
        "meta-viewport",
        "no-bom",
        "no-protocol-relative-urls",
        "scoped-svg-styles",
        "sri",
        "typescript-config/consistent-casing",
        "typescript-config/import-helpers",
        "typescript-config/is-valid",
        "typescript-config/no-comments",
        "typescript-config/strict",
        "typescript-config/target"
    ],
    "hintsTimeout": 10000,
    "parsers": [
        "babel-config",
        "css",
        "html",
        "javascript",
        "jsx",
        "less",
        "sass",
        "typescript",
        "typescript-config",
        "webpack-config"
    ]
}
```

If you want more control over the hints and parsers that get activated, create a local `.hintrc` file to configure webhint.  For help with output from specific hints, see [webhint user guide](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/configuring-webhint/summary).
