# Edge Web Store curation and reviews

The Microsoft Edge Add-Ons Store has curated the Edge store experience so that users can find all items like themes, extensions, and apps to customize their browser at one place.

Before installing an item from the Edge Add-Ons Store, users can learn more about the functionality, data permissions, and publisher by viewing the description and listing.

## Organizing Edge Add-Ons Store items

The store organizes the items to help users discover the ones that are relevant to their interests.

Users can also discover the items they are interested in on the Edge Add-Ons Store in several ways such as the home page, search bar, multiple curated collections, and categories.

The following factors are used to organize items:
