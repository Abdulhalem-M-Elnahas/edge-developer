# Understand WebView2 SDK versions  

To develop a WebView2 application, you must install either the [WebView2 Runtime][MicrosoftDeveloperEdgeWebview2] or a [non-stable Microsoft Edge channel][MicrosoftedgeinsiderDownload].  The minimum version that's required is included in the NuGet package version of the SDK.  For example, if you use the `SDK package version 0.9.488`, then you must install either the [WebView2 Runtime][MicrosoftDeveloperEdgeWebview2] or a [non-stable Microsoft Edge channel][MicrosoftedgeinsiderDownload] with a build number of 488 or later.  The minimum version required is also specified in the WebView2 [Release Notes][Releasenotes].  New versions of the WebView2 SDK are shipped at the same general cadence as the Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) browser, which is approximately every six weeks.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When developing Evergreen WebView2 applications, regularly test your application against the latest versions of the WebView2 Runtime and non-stable Microsoft Edge browsers.  Because the web platform is constantly evolving, regular testing is the best way to ensure your application performs as intended.  

## Release and prerelease package  

The WebView2 NuGet package contains both a release and pre-release package.  

The release package is forward compatible and contains the [Win32 C/C++ APIs][ReferenceWin32].  APIs in this SDK are fully supported.  

The prerelease package is a superset of the release package with the additional components listed below.  

*   .NET APIs: [WPF][DotnetMicrosoftWebWebview2WpfNamespace], [WinForms][DotnetMicrosoftWebWebview2WinformsNamespace], and [Core][DotnetMicrosoftWebWebview2CoreNamespace]  
*   Experimental APIs:  For more information, navigate to the [Experimental APIs](#experimental-apis) section.  

## Experimental APIs  

The WebView team is testing experimental APIs that may be included in future releases.  The experimental APIs are marked as `experimental` in the SDK.  Experimental APIs may ship as fully stable APIs in the release package.  You can evaluate the Experimental APIs and share feedback using the [WebView feedback repo][GithubMicrosoftedgeWebviewfeedback].  

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid using the experimental APIs in production apps.  

## Matching WebView2 Runtime versions  

When writing a WebView2 app using a particular SDK version, users of your app may run it with several compatible versions of the WebView2 Runtime.  The WebView team is working on a compatible WebView2 Runtime version that contains non-experimental APIs from previous versions of the Runtime and new non-experimental APIs.  

Depending on which SDK you use, consider the following items: 

*   **Win32 C/C++**.  When using `QueryInterface` to obtain a new interface, check for a return value of `E_NOINTERFACE`.  This value may indicate that the WebView2 Runtime is a previous version, and doesn't support that interface.  
*   **.NET and WinUI**.  Check for a `No such interface supported` exception when using methods, properties, and events that were added to more recent SDKs.  This exception may occur when the WebView2 Runtime is a previous version, and doesn't support those APIs.  

If an API is unavailable, consider removing the associated feature, or inform your users that they need to update their version of the WebView2 Runtime.  

Experimental APIs may be introduced, modified, and removed from SDK to SDK.  Experimental APIs may not be available in your installed version of the WebView2 Runtime.  

## Roadmap  

The release package contains all of the stable, supported Win32 C/C++ APIs.  In the future, the release package will contain all stable, supported .NET APIs when they are made generally available.  The prerelease package contains experimental APIs that are subject to change based upon your feedback and shared insights.  

<!--## Versioning  

After you have used a particular version of the SDK to build your app, your app may end up running with an older or newer version of installed browser binaries.  Until version 1.0.0.0 of WebView2 there may be breaking changes during updates that prevent your SDK from working with different versions of installed browser binaries.  After version 1.0.0.0, different versions of the SDK may work with different versions of the installed browser by using the following best practices.  

1.  To account for breaking changes to the API be sure to check for failure when requesting the DLL export `CreateCoreWebView2Environment` and when running `QueryInterface` on any `CoreWebView2` object.  A return value of `E_NOINTERFACE` indicates that the SDK is not compatible with the Microsoft Edge browser binaries.  
1.  Checking for failure from `QueryInterface` also accounts for cases where the SDK is newer than the version of the Microsoft Edge browser and your app attempts to use an interface of which the Microsoft Edge browser is unaware.  

1.  When an interface is unavailable, you may consider disabling the associated feature if possible, or otherwise informing your users to update their browsers.  -->
