## Features

*  Extended the `ProcessFailed` event.  It now raises for non-renderer child processes and frame renderers.
*  Added `iframe` element support for `AddScriptToExecuteOnDocumentCreated`.
*  Improved WebView2 code to be more resilient to `.exe` application files with malformatted version information.  ([Issue #850](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback/issues/850)).
*  Removed `--winhttp-proxy-resolver` from WebView2 browser process command-line, turned on other proxy command-line options for WebView2.
