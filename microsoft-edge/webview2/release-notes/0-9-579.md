# Release Notes for WebView2 Release SDK 0.9.579

Release Date: July 20, 2020

[NuGet package for WebView2 SDK 0.9.579](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2/0.9.579)

This version of the WebView2 SDK requires Microsoft Edge version 86.0.579.0 or higher.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## All platforms

*  > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **Announcement**: Evergreen WebView2 Runtime and installer is released for preview.  See [Distribute your app and the WebView2 Runtime](concepts/distribution.md).

*  > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **Announcement**:  The following WebView2 SDK Versions are no longer supported after the next SDK release:
   >
   > *  [0.8.190](#08190)
   > *  [0.8.230](#08230)
   > *  [0.8.270](#08270)
   > *  [0.8.314](#08314)
   > *  [0.8.355](#08355)
   >
   > The WebView2 SDK Versions are also marked deprecated on nuget.org.  WebView2 recommends staying up to date with the latest version of WebView2.

*  Added WebView2 worker thread improvements.  ([Issue #318](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback/issues/318)).
*  Turned off the pop-up blocker in WebView2.  See the [IsUserInitiated](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2newwindowrequestedeventargs?view=webview2-0.9.538&preserve-view=true#get_isuserinitiated) property in the `NewWindowRequested` event.
*  Ensured WebView2 navigation starting event is run for `about:blank`.  Now, `NavigationStarting` events are run for all navigation, but cancellations for `about:blank` or `srcdoc` of the `iframe` element aren't supported and ignored.
*  Blocked some `edge://` URI schemes in WebView2.
*  Added experimental [IsSingleSignOnUsingOSPrimaryAccountEnabled](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2experimentalenvironmentoptions?view=webview2-0.9.538-prerelease&preserve-view=true#get_issinglesignonusingosprimaryaccountenabled) property on WebView2 environment options to turn on conditional access for WebView2.
*  Added experimental [WebResourceResponseReceived](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2experimental?view=webview2-0.9.538-prerelease&preserve-view=true#add_webresourceresponsereceived) event that runs after the WebView2 receives and processes the response from a WebResource request.  Authentication headers, if any, are included in the response object.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## .NET

*  Improved WPF focus handling.  ([Issue #185](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback/issues/185)).
*  Added `ZoomFactor` property on WPF Webview2 Controller.
