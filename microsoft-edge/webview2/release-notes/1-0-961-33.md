# Release Notes for WebView2 Release SDK 1.0.961.33

Release Date: September 8, 2021

[NuGet package for WebView2 SDK 1.0.961.33](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2/1.0.961.33)

For full API compatibility, this Release version of the WebView2 SDK requires WebView2 Runtime version 93.0.961.44 or higher.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Promotions

The following APIs have been promoted to Stable and are now included in this Release SDK.

*  [Client Certificate API](/microsoft-edge/webview2/reference/win32/icorewebview2_5?view=webview2-1.0.961.33&preserve-view=true#add_clientcertificaterequested).


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Bug fixes

*  Fixed a bug that caused `ERR_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT_NEEDED` errors. This is a Runtime change.
*  Fixed a bug that special browser keys like **Refresh**, **Home**, **Back**, and so on can't be turned off using `AreBrowserAcceleratorKeysEnabled`. This change is Runtime-specific.
*  Fixed a bug where the transparent background color isn't rendered.
*  Fixed a bug that caused a white flicker when loading WebView2.
*  Fixed a bug in WebView2 .NET controls where WebView2 windows were blank when created in the background. ([Issue #1077](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback/issues/1077))
*  Fixed a bug where settings were not updated when the user navigated to or a new window displayed `about:blank` pages. This is a Runtime change.
