# Recorder features reference

Use the **Recorder** tool to record a series of steps in the browser window or tab where DevTools is opened, and then replay the steps automatically, while optionally also measuring performance.

This article lists all the features that are available in the **Recorder** tool. To learn to use the tool first, see [Record and replay user flows and measure performance](./index.md).
