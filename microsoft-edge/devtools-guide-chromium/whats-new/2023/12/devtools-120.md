# What's New in DevTools (Microsoft Edge 120)

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Edge team note for top of What's New](../../includes/edge-whats-new-note.md)]


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Edge DevTools has a new user interface

DevTools has a new look starting with Edge 120! The major design updates are the new Activity Bar with icons, Quick View, and the ability to easily open, close, and move tools around. Check out our blog post to learn more about the new updates: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2023/12/20/inside-the-all-new-edge-devtools-ui/ 

If you prefer the legacy UI, you can switch back by going to Settings > Preferences and selecting the "Switch back to the legacy DevTools UI" checkbox. After reloading DevTools, the UI will be updated.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Explain with Copilot in DevTools is generally available

You can now ask DevTools to explain any error or warning, and any code snippet by using Copilot in Edge. This feature will be enabled by default for all starting with Edge 120. Check out our blog post to learn more: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2023/12/14/navigate-the-unexpected-using-copilot-in-edge-and-devtools/

 If you don't see the feature, you might need to enable it. To enable this feature, follow the steps outlined [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/experimental-features/copilot-explain#enable-the-features )

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback about the feature, please leave a comment on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools/issues/203).

## Recorder tool is available

Use the recorder tool to help you record and replay common user flows and measure its performance. You can edit your recordings and share them by importing/exporting.

<!-- Not sure if we're allowed to put a Chrome link in this section or if we should put it under the chrome announcements. This tool isn't new to Chrome, but Edge devtools only started supporting it in 120. I'll let you be the judge of where this should go. -LT -->
