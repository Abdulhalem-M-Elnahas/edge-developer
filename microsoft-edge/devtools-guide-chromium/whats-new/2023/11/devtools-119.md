## Updated text color for error pills under the Issues panel

Before Microsoft Edge 119, users with low vision might face difficulties with the color contrast ratio for the error pills.<!-- todo: define -->  The contrast ratio between the foreground color and background color has been updated to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.4.3 requirements:

## Updated text color for tree items under the Application panel

While navigating or hovering over any selected tree item in the **Application** tool, the tree item wasn't clearly visible, which may impact users with low vision or keyboard users.  The text color is now darker, and the tree item is now clearly visible when selected:
