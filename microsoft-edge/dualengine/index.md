# Introduction to Microsoft DualEngine API

The Microsoft DualEngine API allows you to embed and control a Internet Explorer within your app.

The DualEngine API differs from similar APIs like the Web Browser Control by providing a browsing experience
equivalent to a normal Internet Explorer tab for increased compatibility with legacy websites. However this
increase in compatibility comes at the cost of increased developer overhead.

To start building with the DualEngine APi, see [Getting Started with DualEngine API](get-started.md)
